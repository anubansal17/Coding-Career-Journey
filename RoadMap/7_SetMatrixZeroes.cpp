/*
Approach 1: Brute Force, T.C- O(n*m)(n+m), S.C- O(1)
- Provided if the elements in the given matrix will be all positive integers
- Iterate over the matrix if any zero is found, make it's row and column as -1 inplace of 1s, not 0s
- At last, make all -1s as 0's

Approach 2: Using 2 dummy arrays, T.C - O(n*m), S.C- O(n+m)
- Take 2 dummy arrays, one of size as number of rows and other of size as number of columns
- Traverse the matrix, and if any zero is found make the element at corresponding row and column in dummy arrays as 0
- After traversing the complete matrix this way, you would be having zeroes at some of the places at these dummy arrays
- Now, traverse the matrix again and check for values at these dummy arrays
- If any of the value in dummy arrays is 0, make the element in the matrix for corresponding index as 0

Approach 3: Instead of taking 2 explicit dummy arrays, use first row and first column of matrix as dummy arrays, T.C- O(n*m), S.C- O(1)
- Rest of the algo would be same as above
- As matrix[0][0] can be set by two different rows and column, we will handle this case separately

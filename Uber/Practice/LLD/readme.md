1. **Hotel Intervals Correction**

    A hotel has listed their opening and closing hours on their Facebook page for the week. However hotel's social media manager, due to long working           hours,    is prone to making mistakes while listing opening and closing hours on their social media page.

    Help the hotel manager in correcting these mistakes. If there is an overlap in the multiple intervals listed, merge those intervals. Output a list of       intervals where there is no overlap.

    Examples

    Input1:  [(Mon 9:00 -> Mon 17:00), (Tue 9:00 -> Tue 17:00)]
    Output1:  [(Mon 9:00 -> Mon 17:00), (Tue 9:00 -> Tue 17:00)]

    Input 2:  [(Fri 17:00 -> Sat 2:00), (Sat 1:00 -> Sat 15:00) ]
    Output 2 : [(Fri 17:00 -> Sat 15:00) ]

    Input 3: [(Mon 9:00 -> Mon 12:00), (Mon 12:00 -> Mon 17:00)]
    Output 3: [(Mon 9:00 -> Mon 17:00)]

**Leetcode 1842. Next Palindrome Using Same Digits**
Hard

You are given a numeric string num, representing a very large palindrome.

Return the smallest palindrome larger than num that can be created by rearranging its digits. If no such palindrome exists, return an empty string "".

A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:

Input: num = "1221"
Output: "2112"
Explanation: The next palindrome larger than "1221" is "2112".

Example 2:

Input: num = "32123"
Output: ""
Explanation: No palindromes larger than "32123" can be made by rearranging the digits.

Example 3:

Input: num = "45544554"
Output: "54455445"
Explanation: The next palindrome larger than "45544554" is "54455445".
